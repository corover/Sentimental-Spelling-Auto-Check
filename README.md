# Sentimental Analysis And Spelling Auto Check
Sentences will be automatically checked by text or voice as we develop open source sentiment analysis. It will have an algorithm and user interface.

The project is open source, so anyone is welcome to contribute to its development or use the code for their own wellness-related projects. The project's code and assets are available on GitHub, along with instructions on how to set up and use the application.
